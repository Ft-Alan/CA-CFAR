# CFAR-Based Radar Target Detection (RTL + MATLAB)

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) based radar target detection system** using a full signal processing pipeline:

**Beamforming → Power Computation → Power Smoothing → CA-CFAR Detection**

The design is developed in **MATLAB (reference model)** and implemented in **Verilog (RTL)** using **fixed-point arithmetic**, with careful validation between software and hardware behavior.

## 🎯 Key Features

* ✅ **CA-CFAR detector (Cell Averaging)**
* ✅ **Beamforming using 4 antennas**
* ✅ **Fixed-point RTL design**
* ✅ **MATLAB ↔ RTL validation**
* ✅ **Pipeline-aware implementation**
* ✅ **Detection performance analysis (Pd, Pfa)**

## 📊 Signal Model

* Complex Gaussian noise:

  ```
  x = n_r + j n_i
  ```
* Targets injected at specific indices with controlled SNR
* Beamforming enhances signal strength before detection

---

## ⚙️ CFAR Algorithm

Detection rule:

```
CUT > α × Noise Estimate
```

Where:

* CUT = Cell Under Test
* α = scaling factor (threshold control)
* Noise Estimate = average of surrounding training cells

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 📌 MATLAB (Reference Model)

* Signal generation (complex Gaussian noise)
* Target injection
* Beamforming
* Power calculation
* Smoothing
* CFAR detection
* Export to `.mem` files for RTL

### 📌 RTL (Verilog)

Modules:

* `beamformer.v`
* `power_calc.v`
* `power_smooth.v`
* `cfar.v`
* `bram_sp.v` (data input)

Key aspects:

* Fixed-point arithmetic (Q-format)
* Pipeline alignment
* Resource-efficient design

---

## 🧪 Validation

* MATLAB and RTL outputs are compared
* Pipeline delay accounted for
* Matching achieved for:

  * Detection positions
  * Threshold behavior

---

## 📈 Results

| Metric           | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Injected Targets | 64    |
| Detected Targets | 56    |
| Total Detections | 100   |
| False Alarms     | 44    |

### Interpretation:

* CFAR correctly detects targets (Pd ≈ 0.8 at 12 dB SNR)
* Additional detections correspond to **expected false alarms**
* Demonstrates **Pd–Pfa tradeoff**

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoff Insight

* Lower threshold (α ↓):

  * ↑ Detection probability
  * ↑ False alarms

* Higher threshold (α ↑):

  * ↓ False alarms
  * ↓ Detection probability

---

## 🧱 Fixed-Point Design

* MATLAB `fi` used for modeling
* Bit-width alignment with RTL
* Rounding and truncation carefully handled

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

* Pipeline misalignment between MATLAB and RTL
* Fixed-point precision mismatch
* Threshold scaling differences
* Debugging false alarms vs true detections

---

## 🖥️ FPGA Integration

* Input data stored in BRAM (`.mem` files)
* Streaming architecture using address counter
* Detection output visualized using LEDs
